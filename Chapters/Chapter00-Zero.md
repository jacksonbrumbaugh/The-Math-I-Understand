# Zero

How much thought have you ever given the number "zero"?

## What Is Zero?

Can you define zero?

Sure, it's a number

But then,

What even **IS** a number?!?

I like to think of zero as an abstract numerical representation of having no quantity of a thing; or, as a common reference point

Take a number line

Zero acts as the common reference point to separate the positive numbers from the negative numbers, while itself being neither positive nor negative

Then consider having zero apples

Odds are,

you have zero apples right now!

Another, more fundamentally sound definition of zero would be "the number that when added to another number gives a sum of the other number"

Hmmm i suppose a less rigid definition of zero would be "a number that is its own negative"

But that definition feels way less helpful than the others

## Do You Appreciate Zero

Now that you've given zero more consideration than ever before in your life!

... at least, most likely, unless you've taken some advanced mathematics courses ...

Do you appreciate it?

Do you feel a sense of gratitude for the greatness that is the number zero?!?

Haha probably not!

& I don't blame you

Zero is like those little electrons that power the early 21st century

No one pays much attention to them

& yet the 21st century could not function without either of them!

## What Comes Next?

I'm sure you know the answer

But to be extra clear

The next number after zero that should be discussed is ...

The number **one**!
