# Counting

1, 2, 3 ... no wait!

0, 1, 2 ...

## Where I'm Starting

To do most math,

we need some equipment

Such as numbers!

So far,

I've discussed the numbers 0 & 1

While those 2 ...

Oops!

That's a new number!

Two ... what a fine number

Anyway,

while 1 & 0 are fine numbers for computers to work with,

we humans need a LOT more

How about an infinite amount more?

I'm assuming most of you readers are familiar with a base-10, or decimal, counting system

0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 9, 10, 11, & so on & so on

Then ya slap a negative sign in front of each to create even MORE numbers!

An infinite amount positive & an infinite amount negative

## Welcome to Number Theory

Let's give a name to this branch of mathematics

Let's call it ...

Number Theory: a pure study of numbers & the structure they make up

## What About the In Between?

Now I can't forget about that OTHER infinite amount of numbers that exist between 0 & 1

Why not consider the number that is halfway between 0 & 1

Better known as 0.5 or 1/2

Then there are the 2 numbers halfway between each of those numbers

Then we could split each of those segments in half ... again!

We can repeat this halving process for as long as we like

& according the rules of math that I _currently_ understand ...

we will NEVER overlap nor collide into our starting numbers of 0 & 1

... wild!

## Those Pesky Irrationals

So that ought to do it

No more num...

Wait a second!

There are more numbers to account for tho

Numbers like the SqRt{2} or the number e or the complex constant i (i.e. SqRt{-1})

Perhaps THOSE numbers are best discussed after laying a foundation for "algebra"
