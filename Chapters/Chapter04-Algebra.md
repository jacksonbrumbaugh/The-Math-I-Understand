# Algebra

Time to start using all this math mumbo-jumbo to solve some problems

Algebra is a field of mathematics that uses letters and other symbols to represent unknown values as "variables"

## Algebra Conventions

For reasons unknown to me,

the letter "x" is a favorite within the math community to show an mystery value

However,

any letter is fair game!

Q, j, y, n, o ...

well ... perhaps avoid SOME letters like O or I or L since they can be easily mistaken for numbers like 0 and 1

## Quick Algebra Example

Suppose you work part time for a small corn husking operation

You get a paid a base amount of $20 for showing per day plus $0.10 per ear of corn husked

How many ears of corn would you have to husk in one day to leave with $56?

First,

let's translate that sentence into math symbols (so no need for those dollar signs)

56 = 20 + 0.1*x,

where x is the unknown value for the number of hours we would need to work

Using the rules of arithmetic,

we can solve that x must equal 360, or 30 dozen ears of corn

(a dozen of a thing means 12 of that thing)

### The Long-Winded Solve of That Quick Example

As an equation,

we can use all of those arithmetic rules and operations to "solve for x" / "get x by itself"

Remember PEMDAS?

Well when trying to solve an algebra equation (a.k.a. an equation with at least 1 unknown variable),

we simply the equation by reversing the order of PEMDAS

So we use subtraction to "undo" any additions outside of parantheses

We then use division to "undo" any multiplications oustide of parantheses

We "undo" exponents - oddly - with MORE exponents

A quantity raised to the 2 (x ^ 2) gets "undone" by raising it to the 1/2,

since (x ^ 2) ^ (1/2) = x

Most of you may recognize raising to the 1/2 by its usual nickname: the square root

In our above example,

56 = 20 + 0.1\*x "implies that" 36 = 0.1\*x

A fancy math way to shorten "implies that" is to use =>

It is also common for each => part to gets its own line

So the fancy math way to write the steps of solving our example would be:

56 = 20 + 0.1*x

=> 36 = 0.1*x

=> 360 = x

There you have it!

The hidden value for x that makes our equation true **must be** 360

Go ahead,

feel free to "plug it back in" to the original equation

## The Main Rule of Algebra

As with other fields of mathematics,

algebra has a "fundamental theory"

Think of a fundamental theory as the defining characteristic of what makes up that particular field of mathematics

But before we can discuss the Fundamental Theory of Algebra,

we first have to discuss "complex numbers"

### Complex Numbers

Perhaps you've heard of complex numbers before

Or maybe you've heard their _other_ name: "imaginary numbers"

Whichever way you prefer to refer to them,

a complex or imaginery number with a complex component

What's a complex component?

A complex component is a portion of a number using the -1 raised to the 1/2 power

Yep,

SqRt(-1)

Picture this!

You desperately want an answer to the equation x^2 + 1 = 0

Using a few arthimetic rules,

you find that for that equation to have a solution,

you would need to find a number such that after raising it the 2nd power ... gives you -1

But ... but ... but wouldn't any even power result in a positive number

Well ...

Imma let you in a little secret

Mathematicians have been writing and subsequently rewriting the mathematical rulebook for millenia!

So why not allow for some extravagant number that results in a -1 when raised to the 2nd power

Such a number would open a huge can of worms of previously unsolvable algebraic equations!

Technically,

this odd value / "constant" could have any name or symbol to represent it

If you're curious about the history behind this "imaginary constant",

I'd highly recommend the adventure

But I'll just tell you that it's widely accepted to use the letter "i" as the complex constant

In other words,

i = SqRt(-1) = (-1)^(1/2)

Thus,

from the rules of exponents,

i^2 = -1

Therefore,

a complex number is any number that can be written in the form A + B*i,

where A and B are "real" numbers

What's a real number?

Oops ... stumbled right into number theory, there, didn't i?

Without going too deep into the rabbit hole that is number theory,

for now,

just know that a real number is a number that in no way uses the complex constant of i

### Polynomials

The other vital piece of math lingo that's helpful to understand before the big reveal of the Fundamental Thereom of Algebra is the "polynomial"

To any who recognize their Latin roots ... "poly" is a Latin prefix meaning "many"

Which leaves the "nomial" part,

and "nomial" means a name or term,

probably better known as any value or number

And we can represent those nomials as variables!

Nomials can be added together,

and multiplied to each other

#### Polynomial Examples

Some examples of polynomials are:

- x^2 + 1
- x - 7
- 3x^5 - 11x^2 + 13

Notice how the polynomials do not need to use an equals sign

#### Coefficients

"Coefficient" is the fancy label for "a number multiplying a variable"

So from those examples,

the coefficient of x^2 is 1,

since there is an assumed 1 if no coefficient is shown

The coefficient of x^5 is 3 and of x^2 is 11

The "constant coefficient" is the number that is not multiplied by any power of the variable,

so the 1, -7, and 13 in the above examples

#### Polynomial Degree

The "degree" of a polynomial is the highest exponent of its variable

So for those 3 examples of polynomials above,

they're degrees would be:

- 2
- 1
- 5

#### Roots of a Polynomial

A "root" of a polynomial is any value for the variable that would set the polynomial equal to zero

For the first 2 of those examples above,

they're roots would be:

- +/- i
- 7

That third example (3x^5 - 11x^2 + 13) is much trickier and is left as an excerise for the reader,

or ... check out WolframAlpha.com

## The Big Reveal

Now you are ready for the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra,

which states that every polynomial of degree n with complex number coefficients has n complex number roots

Therefore,

any system that you can translate into numbers and represent with polynomials is guaranteed to have complex roots (or solutions)!

The trouble: a complex solution is unlikely to have much "real world" usefullness

So better hope for some "real roots"!
