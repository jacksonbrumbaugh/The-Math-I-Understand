# Arithmetic

Having numbers to count is great & all

But how about we DO something with all these infinity of things?!?

## What Is Arithmetic

Arithmetic is all the operations that we can do with numbers

Operations like addition, or division, or exponentiation

## Deeper Look at Number Operations

A numerical operation takes in 2 numbers as inputs,

then returns any determined amount of output numbers

Typically the operation will output 1 number ...

Until you get to vectors

BUT!

That is a tale for a much much later chapter

## Addition

Addition is fast counting

If I ask you, "What is 3 + 4?"

Essentially I am asking you to either:

A. Count 4 numbers bigger than 3, or

B. Count 3 numbers bigger than 4

Since counting is a known pattern,

3 + 4 is the same as asking 4 + 3

This swapping action is known as the "Commutative Property of Addition"

It is a great property,

but not all operations have this property

To jump some levels,

consider exponents

2 ^ 3 =/= 3 ^ 2

since 2 ^ 3 = 8

while 3 ^ 2 = 9

Lumped in with addition is subraction

Which,

subtraction is merely "adding the opposite" of the second input to your first input

Thus,

any subraction of A - B can be thought of instead as A + (-B)

So if you turn your head upside & squint a little ...

it's almost like subtractions doesn't even exist!

## Inverse Operation

Well ...

To be fair to subtraction,

subtraction definitely exists

It is known as the inverse operation to addition

What's an inverse operation, you ask?

Excellent question!

In the simplest of terms,

an inverse operation "undoes" the operation that it is an inverse of

### Math Machines ... Ya know ... Functions

Let's consider 2 machines ...

In fact,

Let's call these machines "functions"

Function A adds 5 to any number that is given

Can you determine what the inverse function, called B, must be?

Function B subtracts 5 to any input number

In common fancy math write-up,

function A would be written as: A(x) = x + 5

then function B written as: B(x) = x - 5

Quick side note: the letters A & B are trivial; we can pick ANY symbol we desire to "label" our functions

### Testing For an Inverse Function

We "test" if the functions A() & B() are inverses of each other by "plugging them" into each other

This might look strange ...

A(B(x)) means to first do all the operations that B() wants to do on x & THEN take that output and use it as an input to A()

so ...

A(B(x)) = A(x - 5) = (x - 5) + 5 = x - (5 + 5) = x - 0 = x

Oops!

I used another fancy property there ...

the "Associative Property of Addition"

#### Associative Property of Addition

The Associative Property of Addition states it is "mathematically okay" to move around those paraenthesis for (x - 5) + 5

Cause ya see ...

Addition only allows us to add 1 number to another number

But it keeps quiet about simultaneously adding 3 numbers together

### Testing For an Inverse Function ~ Part II

To be thorough,

simply finding that A(B(x)) = x is only Step 1 of the process

It must ALSO be true that doing the A() function first & then plugging into B() yields x

For our above example,

B(A(x)) = B(x + 5) = (x + 5) - 5 = x + (5 - 5) = x + 0 = x

Therefore,

yes!

A() & B() are inverse functions of each other

## Multiplication

If we view addition as "fast counting",

then mulicplication is "fast addition"

Learning how to multiple helps us to "add up" clusters of quantites

How much would 4 "clusters" with each cluster containing 7 items

Why that's 4 * 7!

Better known as 28

## Division

Traveling down that same river,

division is "fast subtraction"

Asking A / B is the same as asking "How many times can B be subtracted from A?"

From this point of view,

it is clear that "diving by 0" makes no sense

Because subtracting 0 from anyting brings you directly back to THAT THING

It's like ... kinda the definition of zero

Thus,

you would enter a never-ending loop ...

an infinite loop ...

of continuously trying to subtract yet another zero

## Exponents, or Exponentiation

Raising a number to a power, or exponentiation, is then "fast multiplication"

To my knowledge here on 2022.12.29 ... we don't get a "fast exponentiation"

... at least ... not in "normal everyday math"

## A Factorial Tease

Although,

there are functions that "grow" / "tend toward infinity" faster than exponentiation ...

Again,

tho,

let's save that "fact"-orial for a later chapter!

## Order of Operations

Hopefully you've all heard of PEMDAS

If not,

then do I have a trick for you!

Do you ever have trouble remember the order that you're supposed to simply a bunch of arithmetic operations?

PEMDAS is the mneumonic device to help remember ...

- Parantheses
- Exponents
- Multiplication / Division
- Addition / Subtraction

I put "Multiplication / Division" and "Addition / Subtraction" on shared lines since the division and subtraction are the inverse operations of multiplication and addition

So in other words,

any division can be written instead as a multiplication,

and any subtraction can be written instead as an addition
